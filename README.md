## VGChartz Scraper (Forked)
This is a forked version of the original vgchartzfull Python script that scrapes data from the VGChartz Game Database (http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/).

## Intent of Changes
This forked version has been modified to improve the error handling, add retries for failed data fetches, and separate each variable into columns for the final CSV output. The script also saves a backup CSV after each page is scraped.

Please note that this fork is a work-in-progress and the code is still quite rough. It has been forked and modified for personal use and is not intended to be merged back into the original repository.

## Credits
The original BeautifulSoup-based scraper was created by Chris Albon. More information can be found on their website: http://chrisalbon.com/python/beautiful_soup_scrape_table.html
